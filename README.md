This Python script is a simple Wi-Fi network scanner that uses the nmcli command-line tool to detect nearby Wi-Fi networks. It defines a function run_command to execute shell commands safely, optionally capturing their output. The scan_networks function runs the nmcli command to list available Wi-Fi networks, extracting their SSIDs and BSSIDs. The main function orchestrates the scanning process, printing a list of detected networks with their SSIDs and BSSIDs. If no networks are found, it notifies the user accordingly. The script provides a straightforward way to programmatically scan and display nearby Wi-Fi access points on systems where nmcli is available.
